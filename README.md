# Solving-N-Queen-by-using-Genetic-Algorithm


##what is GA? 
###The genetic algorithm (GA) is the most widely known type of evolutionary algorithm, and it is one of methods which tries to find optimum solution in a space with using an iterative algorithm.

##How GA works?
###First a random population without any force must create after that due to performance of each chromosome, they can be candidate to choose as a parent to create child. Next, in term of aging new child will replace previous generation and this this algorithm repeated to find solution.

##Two goals for a theory of GA are:
###(1) to describe in detail how schemas are processed.
###(2) to predict the degree to which a given problem will be easy or difficult for the GA.

## what is Eight queens puzzle??
###The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century

##Fitness Function:
The fitness function simply defined is a function which takes a candidate solution to the problem as input and produces as output how “fit” our how “good” the
solution is with respect to the problem in consideration.

• Swap mutation implied with rate of 80 percent.
• Cross-and-fill cross over applied with rate of 100 percent.
• Parent would select like a race
• New child replace the worst one
